Embedded Development on STM32 with CLion and the Segger Tools

The [CLion IDE from Jetbrains] (https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/) is a very powerful IDE for C/C++ developments with lots of features to increase developer productivity. This small demo project shows how to use CLion for embedded development. The Tools used are the [nucleo- board from ST] (http://www.st.com/content/st_com/en/products/evaluation-tools/product-evaluation-tools/mcu-eval-tools/stm32-mcu-eval-tools/stm32-mcu-nucleo/nucleo-l476rg.html) but the approach should work on any platform with a gcc compiler, a gdb debugger and a gdbserver on the target or on some sort of JTAG- Probe
